# Crafting Interpreters in Rust

I have been reading [Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) and I decided to follow the book in Rust instead of Java.
Most of the Rust code in this repo is a naive line-by-line translation of the Java code present in the book, so the code may not be Rust-yâ„¢ enough.
